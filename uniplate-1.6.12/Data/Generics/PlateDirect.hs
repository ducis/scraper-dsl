    /DEPRECATED/: Use "Data.Generics.Uniplate.Direct" instead.

    This module supplies a method for writing 'Biplate' instances more easily.
    This module requires fewest extensions, highest performance, and most instance
    definitions.
    
    To take an example:
    
    > data Expr = Var Int | Pos Expr String | Neg Expr | Add Expr Expr
    > data Stmt = Seq [Stmt] | Sel [Expr] | Let String Expr
    >
    > instance Uniplate Expr where
    >     uniplate (Var x  ) = plate Var |- x
    >     uniplate (Pos x y) = plate Pos |* x |- y
    >     uniplate (Neg x  ) = plate Neg |* x
    >     uniplate (Add x y) = plate Add |* x |* y
    >
    > instance Biplate Expr Expr where
    >     biplate = plateSelf
    >
    > instance Uniplate Stmt where
    >     uniplate (Seq x  ) = plate Seq ||* x
    >     uniplate (Sel x  ) = plate Sel ||+ x
    >     uniplate (Let x y) = plate Let |-  x |- y
    >
    > instance Biplate Stmt Stmt where
    >     biplate = plateSelf
    >
    > instance Biplate Stmt Expr where
    >     biplate (Seq x  ) = plate Seq ||+ x
    >     biplate (Sel x  ) = plate Sel ||* x
    >     biplate (Let x y) = plate Let |-  x |* y
